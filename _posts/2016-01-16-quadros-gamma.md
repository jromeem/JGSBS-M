## Overview
Introducing Quadros Gamma: a fun and simple game that pushes your brain’s capabilities to new levels. The concept is simple: it starts with a 3x3 matrix with some cells highlighted and others left blank. The user only sees this pattern for a moment then it all goes blank. It's now up to the user to recall where those shaded regions were located on the matrix. The game becomes increasingly harder as the matrix evolves into a larger matrix with more highlighed cells, and other transformations. This game is super simple at it’s core, anyone will be able to understand it in just a few seconds. What’s also great about Quadros is the fact that you are actually training your brain while you are having fun playing this addicting game!

## History
This app was originally created for Android as a project for my CS 378: Mobile Computing class in the fall of 2012, back when I was attending UT. Fast-forward two years later, my friend Lulu and I decided to take on the iOS development for this game on our own. We didn't know any Objective-C at the time, so this was our first iOS app ever and we are pretty proud of it! Through our collaboration, Lulu and I also founded our company, [Two Syllables](). We hope to produce more games in the near future~
