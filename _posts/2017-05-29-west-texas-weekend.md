Memorial Day weekend I took a trip out to west Texas. I got to hike up the tallest point in Texas on a mountain called Guadalupe Peak. Afterward I drove to El Paso to get some climbing done at Hueco Tanks, and finally I revisited the White Sands National Monument in New Mexico.

A lot of adventures, a lot of driving, a lot of fun :)
